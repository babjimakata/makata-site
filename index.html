    <h2 class="section-title">The Lens of Kibera – My Photography Story</h2>
    <p class="about-text">In the heart of Kibera, where narrow pathways buzz with life and every corner has a story, lives Babji Shadrack, a young dreamer with a camera and a vision. While many saw the challenges around them, I saw beauty — in the laughter of children playing, in the golden light over rooftops at sunset, and in the strength and smiles of my community.</p>
    
    <p class="about-text">My passion for photography began with a borrowed phone. I would capture daily scenes — shoes lined outside doors, street vendors selling fruits, friends laughing under the Nairobi sun. These weren’t just pictures. They were moments, memories, and truths frozen in time.</p>

    <p class="about-text">As I shared my photos online, people started to take notice. My work spoke without words. Each image told a story of resilience, joy, love, and pride. Photography became more than a hobby — it became my voice, my way of showing the world that beauty lives everywhere, even in unexpected places.</p>

    <p class="about-text">One of the pivotal moments in my photography journey came when I joined the Young City Dance Crew. As I captured their rehearsals and performances, I learned the beauty of movement and the way light interacts with bodies in motion. Their energy and passion became an endless source of inspiration for me. I started to experiment more with dynamic shots, capturing not just moments, but stories told through dance and expression.</p>

    <p class="about-text">Another significant influence was the Watoto Library, which became a second home for me. The library is not just a place for books, but also a space for creativity and community. It’s here that I first learned about photography as an art form, and where I met mentors who guided me on technical skills and the power of storytelling. The library’s open workshops and creative environment allowed me to experiment with my craft, giving me the tools and support to develop my skills further.</p>

    <p class="about-text">Today, I walk through Kibera with my camera, still capturing magic in the ordinary. I dream of holding exhibitions, traveling the world, and teaching other young people how to tell their own stories through the lens. Because for me, photography isn’t just about taking pictures — it’s about changing perspectives.</p>
